This Streamlit application allows users to capture images via webcam and get a detailed, real-time audio description using a combination of the Groq AI API and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). It is designed to assist visually impaired users or those who need instant descriptions of their surroundings.

## Features

- **Webcam Image Capture**: Users can capture images using the built-in camera functionality of their device.
- **Image-to-Text Conversion**: Images are processed through the Groq API using the LLaMA 3.2 Vision model to generate a descriptive text response.
- **Audio Description**: The generated description is converted to speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) API and played back automatically.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can regenerate descriptions for the captured image and replay the audio at any time.
- **Responsive UI**: The UI includes a clean layout with logos, buttons for user interaction, and sound effects for actions like capturing images and regenerating descriptions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

1. **API Keys**:
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`: Groq API key for image-to-text generation.
   - `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`: Langsmith API key for tracing.
   
   Store these keys in a `.env` file in the project directory.

2. **Python Dependencies**:
   - `streamlit`
   - `groq`
   - `gTTS`
   - `PIL` (Pillow)
